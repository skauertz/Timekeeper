Timekeeper is a simple time-tracking app based on Qt and QML.
</b></p>

---

Timekeeper is a simple app to facilitate time tracking over various tasks and provide some simple statistics on it. It is mainly meant to support more accurate booking of time to different projects, but it can also be used for other purposes, from monitoring speaker time in plenary discussions to tracking how much time you spend in various video games.

Timekeeper is a purely local application. None of your data is saved in the Cloud, and no online account is necessary. All your data is saved locally in a file you specify and can optionally be encrypted.

Timekeeper is currently considered feature-complete, with a lot of testing already done by the author. Nevertheless, <b>bugs are possible</b>, so donâ€™t hesitate to open an issue if something does not work as expected.

### Compiling from source
Timekeeper has been developed with QtCreator 4.6.2, and the source code repository includes a project file for it. This should allow you to import the project directly into QtCreator. Provided you have an appropriate kit for your platform you should be able to compile it without any problems.

Timekeeper has been developed and tested using Qt 5.11.1. Any Qt version later than this should be compatible.
