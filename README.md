Timekeeper is a simple time-tracking app based on Qt and QML.
</b></p>

---

Timekeeper is a simple app to facilitate time tracking over various tasks and provide some simple statistics on it. It is mainly meant to support more accurate booking of time to different projects, but it can also be used for other purposes, from monitoring speaker time in plenary discussions to tracking how much time you spend in various video games.

Timekeeper is a purely local application. None of your data is saved in the Cloud, and no online account is necessary. All your data is saved locally in a file you specify and can optionally be encrypted.

Timekeeper is currently considered in Beta phase, with a lot of testing already done by the author, and all features considered complete. Nevertheless, <b>bugs are possible</b>, so keep backups of your data files and donâ€™t hesitate to open an issue if something does not work as expected.

---

### Windows Installation
A release package for Windows can be downloaded from the [Release] page.

Timekeeper does not require system-wide installation. All necessary libraries are included in the download. Just extract the archive in a location of your choice and start `Timekeeper.exe` from there.

Timekeeper has been tested on Windows 10 only. Other versions of Windows may work, but are not officially supported.

---

### Linux Installation
A release package for Linux can be downloaded from the [Release] page.

Timekeeper does not require system-wide installation. All necessary libraries are included in the download. Just extract the archive in a location of your choice and start it by launching `Timekeeper.sh` from there. This makes sure Timekeeper uses the Qt libraries provided with the download instead of the system libraries.

Note: Make sure both `Timekeeper` and `Timekeeper.sh` are made executable, or the application won't run.

---

### Compiling from source
Timekeeper has been developed with QtCreator 4.6.2, and the source code repository includes a project file for it. This should allow you to import the project directly into QtCreator. Provided you have an appropriate kit for your platform you should be able to compile it without any problems.

Timekeeper has been developed using Qt 5.11.1. Any Qt version later than this should be compatible.
